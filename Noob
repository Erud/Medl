This is the solution that worked for me to resolve the "Error: Resizing Existing FAT Partition" message

Open Command prompt with administrative privileges
DISKPART
LIST DISK (You need this to find the Disk # of your USB Drive. On most machines, it will be "Disk 1‚Äù)
SELECT DISK 1
CLEAN
CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY
SELECT PARTITION 1
ACTIVE
FORMAT FS=FAT32 QUICK
ASSIGN
EXIT
Unzip Recalbox.zip to the USB
