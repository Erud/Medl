---------- DONE --------------------------Investigate LDAPS requests failing on port 389 for Domain Controllers
Point of contact: Chris Gray

Details: Currently, all tests from both Softerra and SaltStack when using TLS are failing.  SSL works in Softerra, but is not supported by SaltStack, they require TLSv1 or above.  Can we please work with Microsoft to determine why our DCs do not currently answer to TLS calls on port 389, which is the default LDAPS TLS port?  I’m certain that InfoSec would also appreciate making this improvement as well.  I do not think we need to disable any existing protocols to enable TLS, so it should not have any effects on existing systems.
Softerra window sbaseed uses SSL
SaltStack linux - TLS

    Take a look in \\munhrd1\server team\Security\HiTrust - there are registry files I used years ago to do the SSL/TLS configuration to disable all but TLS 1.2 and enable 1.2
​[2:03 PM] Gray, Chris (I/S)
    I'm guessing, since SSL works and TLS doesn't, that Enable TLS 1.2 has not been imported
​[2:05 PM] Gray, Chris (I/S)
    If you're unsure which ones to run, stick to just Enable_TLSv12 as it adds function, but does not take any away.  It would be the safest way to proceed.
